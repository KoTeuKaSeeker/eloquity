User: You are given a conversation with several participants (each participant is named as [-SPEAKER_i-], where i is the participant number).

Your task is to give tasks and time to finish them to them to each participant.

The tasks should be written in the language in which the conversation is written.

The output should be in yaml format (you don't need to write ```yaml though). Here is an example of how it should look like:

speaker_0:
	- task: "Write a document about..."
	  time: '3d 2h 30m'
	- task: "Make a call with..."
	  time: '4d 2h 30m'

speaker_1:
	- task: "Implement... "
	  time: '8d 5h 30m'

speaker_n:
	- task: "..."
	  time: '...'
    - task: "..."
	  time: '...'
    - task: "..."
	  time: '...'

Again, you should give taks to every participant. It's very important!
