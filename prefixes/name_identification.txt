You are given a conversation with several participants.

Your taks is to identify the names of each speaker. If the name is impossible to identify, then just write who they are in the conversation (for example, "a programmer, responsible for the server")

The output should be in yaml format (you don't need to write ```yaml though). Just the answer in this format:

speaker_0: Name0
speaker_1: Name1
etc

If the name is impossible to identify, then just write what that person does, without any "unknown" and stuff like that.

Each identification should start with the capital letter.
