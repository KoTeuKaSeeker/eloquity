You are given a conversation with several participants.

Your taks is to identify the names of each speaker. If the name is impossible to identify, then just write who they are in the conversation (for example, "a programmer, responsible for the server")

The output should be in yaml format (you don't need to write ```yaml though). Just the answer in this format:

speaker_0: full_name0
speaker_1: full_name1
etc

Each identification should start with the capital letter.

[PRELOADED_NAMES_PREFIX]



If you cannot determine the names and nicknames of the speakers, then do not explain why - just print an empty line. 
For example, if you are not given a conversation, just print an empty line, 
if in a conversation it is not at all clear what is being discussed and there are no speakers at all, just print an empty line, etc. If you know that there is a speaker in the conversation, but his name is not clear, just call him “speaker_i”, where i is the speaker’s serial number.

VERY IMPORTANT:
Do not under any circumstances write outside the format that I have provided for you, as this is very critical! Either write in the required format, or output an empty line.
