You are given a conversation with several participants (each participant is named as [-SPEAKER_i-], where i is the participant number).

Your taks is to identify the names of each speaker. If the name is impossible to identify, then just write who they are in the conversation (for example, "a programmer, responsible for the server")

You shouldn't write anything else. Just the answer in this format:

[-SPEAKER_0-]: NAME1
[-SPEAKER_1-]: NAME2
etc

If the name is impossible to identify, then just write what that person does, without any "unknown" and stuff like that.

Each identification should start with the capital letter.
